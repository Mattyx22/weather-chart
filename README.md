My first React.js project that shows temperature for a few days on a chart.
It's getting data from Dark Sky API.

### To install:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mattyx22/weather-chart.git
cd weather-chart
npm install
npm start
```

~~Because it's not configured for cors you should install that plugin to make the app work:
https://mybrowseraddon.com/access-control-allow-origin.html?v=0.1.1&type=install~~

I made some fix with CORS. It uses corsanywhere api and everything should work fine now.
